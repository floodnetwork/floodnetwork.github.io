## What went wrong?

The main reason for failure was inexperience. Startups are hard, especially when you have children on the way.
The second biggest reason was choosing an application that was important, but not very profitable. Local authorities are still under financial pressure in 2024, the Environment Agency has been under-funded for decades, so the customer base had little money. 
From a technology perspective the LoRaWAN ecosystem has been successful, but the promised LPWAN national coverage never materialised (LoRaWAN, Sigfox, N-Wave, NB-IOT, LTE-M). Creating a wireless operator from license-exempt spectrum seems to be too high an investment vs risk, so LPWAN has remained a self-serve network model in many countries. Building your own infrastructure upsets the cost model significantly, but does mean you're not at the mercy of the operators to reach literal backwaters.

## What would you do differently?

Find someone with better business development skills who could find us a profitable market. Having come from a technology background I was absorbed by the huge challenges early on creating sensors and learning embedded hardware development, but what was the point unless we had a profitable target market?

I learnt a lot which has continued to serve me in my career, to the point where I find myself developing the manufacturing IoT platform and strategy for a major automotive company.
